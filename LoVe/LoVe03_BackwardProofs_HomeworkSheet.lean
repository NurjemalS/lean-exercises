/- ## Question 1 (5 points): Connectives and Quantifiers

1.1 (4 points). Complete the following proofs using basic tactics such as
`intro`, `apply`, and `exact`.

Hint: Some strategies for carrying out such proofs are described at the end of
Section 3.3 in the Hitchhiker's Guide. -/

theorem B (a b c : Prop) :
    (a → b) → (c → a) → c → b :=
  by
    intro h1     
    intro h2      
    intro hc      
    apply h1
    apply h2
    exact hc

theorem S (a b c : Prop) :
    (a → b → c) → (a → b) → a → c :=
  by
    intro h1     
    intro h2     
    intro ha     
    apply h1
    exact ha
    apply h2
    exact ha

theorem more_nonsense (a b c d : Prop) :
    ((a → b) → c → d) → c → b → d :=
  by
    intro h1      
    intro hc     
    intro hb     
    apply h1
    intro ha     
    exact hb
    exact hc

theorem even_more_nonsense (a b c : Prop) :
    (a → b) → (a → c) → a → b → c :=
  by
    intro h1      
    intro h2      
    intro ha    
    intro hb      
    apply h2
    exact ha

/- 1.2 (1 point). Prove the following theorem using basic tactics. -/

theorem weak_peirce (a b : Prop) :
    ((((a → b) → a) → a) → b) → b :=
  by
    intro h
    apply h
    intro h1      
    apply h1
    intro ha      
    apply h
    intro h2      
    exact ha


/- ## Question 2 (5 points): Logical Connectives

2.1 (1 point). Prove the following property about double negation using basic
tactics.

Hints:

* Keep in mind that `¬ a` is defined as `a → False`. You can start by invoking
  `simp [Not]` if this helps you.

* You will need to apply the elimination rule for `False` at a key point in the
  proof. -/

theorem herman (a : Prop) :
    ¬¬ (¬¬ a → a) :=
  by
    intro h            
    have hem : a ∨ ¬ a := Classical.em a
    apply Or.elim hem
    · intro ha         
      apply h
      intro hnnA       
      exact ha
    · intro hna        
      apply h
      intro hnnA       
      apply False.elim
      apply hnnA
      exact hna

/- 2.2 (2 points). Prove the missing link in our chain of classical axiom
implications.

Hints:

* One way to find the definitions of `DoubleNegation` and `ExcludedMiddle`
  quickly is to

  1. hold the Control (on Linux and Windows) or Command (on macOS) key pressed;
  2. move the cursor to the identifier `DoubleNegation` or `ExcludedMiddle`;
  3. click the identifier.

* You can use `rw DoubleNegation` to unfold the definition of
  `DoubleNegation`, and similarly for the other definitions.

* You will need to apply the double negation hypothesis for `a ∨ ¬ a`. You will
  also need the left and right introduction rules for `∨` at some point. -/

#check DoubleNegation
#check ExcludedMiddle

theorem EM_of_DN :
    DoubleNegation → ExcludedMiddle :=
  by
    intro dn         
    intro a          
    apply dn (a ∨ ¬ a)
    intro h          
    apply h
    apply Or.inr
    intro ha        
    apply h
    apply Or.inl
    exact ha

/- 2.3 (2 points). We have proved three of the six possible implications
between `ExcludedMiddle`, `Peirce`, and `DoubleNegation`. State and prove the
three missing implications, exploiting the three theorems we already have. -/

theorem DN_of_EM :
    ExcludedMiddle → DoubleNegation :=

    apply Peirce_of_EM     -- goal: ExcludedMiddle

    apply EM_of_DN         -- goal: DoubleNegation
    apply DN_of_Peirce     -- goal: Peirce
    exact hp

theorem Peirce_of_DN :
    DoubleNegation → Peirce :=
  by
    intro hdn              -- hdn : DoubleNegation
